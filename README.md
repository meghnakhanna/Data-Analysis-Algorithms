# Data-Analysis-Algorithms
Compilation fo data analysis algorithms
  
  
 # Project's aim
 Part A:
 Document Clustering using EM maximization methods on the clustering algorithm to cluster documents into definitive clusters.
 
 Part B:
 Comapre the precision of the 2 algorithms i.e compare the accuracy of a perceptron versus a neural network for a non-linear data
 
 Part C:
 Self Taught Learning
In this part, I implemented the self-taught learning for a 3 layer Neural Network using an Autoencoder and analysed the reconstruction error rate for the self-taught learning model with the increase in layers of the neural net.

# Datasets
## Task 2A.txt-  Part A

## Task 2B_test.csv and Task2B_train.csv - Part B

## Task 2C_labeled.csv, Task2C_unlabeled.csv and Task2C_test.csv - Part C


# Setup
 
## Using Anaconda


### Add a R kernel to your jupyter notebook by building a new environment in your anaconda navugator and selecting R kernel and python and launching that virtual environemnt.

## Using the command line/terminal for Mac and linux users

## Commands

Ctrl-Alt-T - shortcut to open terminal
