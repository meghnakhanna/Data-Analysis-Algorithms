# Data-Analysis-Algorithms
Compilation fo data analysis algorithms
  
  
 # Project's aim
 Part A:
 Document Clustering using EM maximization methods on the clustering algorithm to cluster documents into definitive clusters.
 
 Part B:
 Comapre the precision of the 2 algorithms i.e compare the accuracy of a perceptron versus a neural network for a non-linear data
 
 Part C:
 Self Taught Learning
 Implementation of an autoencoder on a neural network to test the error rate of a neural net
